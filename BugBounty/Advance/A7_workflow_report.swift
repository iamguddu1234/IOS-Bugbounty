     Bug Bounty Workflow and Reporting: Providing guidance on the bug bounty workflow, including scoping, vulnerability submission, validation, and communication with program owners.
     """
    let wa2 = """
     Bug bounty programs typically follow a specific workflow that includes scoping, vulnerability submission, validation, and communication with program owners. Here\'s a breakdown of the bug bounty workflow and reporting process:
     """
    let wa3 = """
     Familiarize yourself with the bug bounty program\'s guidelines, rules, and scope. Understand the target applications, systems, or platforms that are in scope for testing. Review any specific testing requirements, restrictions, or target areas mentioned by the program.
     """
    let wa4 = """
     Conduct thorough reconnaissance and testing of the target applications within the program\'s scope. Use various techniques, tools, and methodologies to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Follow responsible disclosure practices, and avoid causing any harm to the target systems or compromising user data.
     """
    let wa5 = """
     Once you identify a vulnerability, document it with detailed information. Include a clear description of the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, and any supporting evidence or proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the impact. Take screenshots or record videos if necessary to provide additional context.
     """
    let wa6 = """
     Follow the bug bounty program\'s specified process for submitting vulnerabilities. This usually involves filling out a vulnerability report form or template provided by the program. Provide all the necessary details about the vulnerability and attach any relevant files or PoCs.
     """
    let wa7 = """
     The program\'s security team will review your vulnerability submission and validate the reported issue. They will assess the severity, impact, and exploitability of the vulnerability. The validation process may involve further communication between you and the program\'s security team for clarifications or additional information.
     """
    let wa8 = """
     If the vulnerability is valid and meets the program\'s criteria, you will receive acknowledgment for your finding. The program may also reward you with a bounty or a predetermined monetary or non-monetary reward based on the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
     """
    let wa9 = """
     After the reported vulnerability is fixed by the program owner, you may be asked to verify the fix to ensure it effectively addresses the issue. Provide the necessary information or PoCs to demonstrate that the fix is implemented correctly.
     """
    let wa10 = """
     Maintain open and respectful communication with the program owner or security team throughout the process. Respond promptly to their inquiries or requests for additional information. Keep track of all communication related to the bug bounty program, including emails, messages, or other forms of communication.
     """
    let wa11 = """
     Remember to adhere to the bug bounty program\'s guidelines, respect their rules, and maintain the highest ethical standards during the entire workflow and reporting process.
